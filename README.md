# About
I decided to make a gym log because in my daily life when looking for a gym log for my use I didn't find any that had the ease of use that I needed. 
An important part of the gym is to track your progress in sets, reps and weights. I made the gym log customizable for any workout split. This website is useful to me and I hope can be useful to others.

Here is how you can expect to add exercises to the log:

And this is an example of how a populated gym log looks like:
